<blockquote>
<p>A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did I just lose you? Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;d be lost, too! All those terms that only mean something to the already-initiated in Functional Programming&#x2122; (FP) are just jumbled nonsense to many of the rest of us.</p>
<p>This book is not going to teach you what those words mean. If that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, keep looking. In fact, there&apos;s already plenty of great books that teach FP the <em>right way</em>, from the top-down. Those words have important meanings and if you formally study FP in-depth, you&apos;ll absolutely want to get familiar with them.</p>
<p>But this book is going to approach the topic quite differently. I&apos;m going to present fundamental FP concepts from the ground-up, with fewer special or non-intuitive terms than most approaches to FP. We&apos;ll try to take a practical approach to each principle rather than a purely academic angle. <strong>There will be terms</strong>, no doubt. But we&apos;ll be careful and deliberate about introducing them and explaining why they&apos;re important.</p>
<p>Sadly, I am not a card-carrying member of the FP cool kids club. I&apos;ve never been formally taught anything about FP. And though I have a CS academic background and I was decent at math, mathematical notation is not how my brain understands programming. I have never written a line of Scheme, Clojure, or Haskell. I&apos;m not an old-school Lisp&apos;r.</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> attended countless conference talks about FP, each one with the desperate clinging hope that finally, <em>this time</em>, would be the time I understood what this whole functional programming mysticism is all about. And each time, I came away frustrated and reminded that those terms got all mixed up in my head and I had no idea if or what I learned. Maybe I learned things. But I couldn&apos;t figure out what those things were, for the longest time.</p>
<p>Little by little, across those various exposures, I teased out bits and pieces of important concepts that seem to just come all too naturally to the formal FPer. I learned them slowly and I learned them pragmatically and experientially, not academically with appropriate terminology. Have you ever known a thing for a long time, and only later found out it had a specific name you never knew!?</p>
<p>Maybe you&apos;re like me; I heard terms like &quot;map-reduce&quot; around industry segments like &quot;big data&quot; for years with no real idea what they were. Eventually I learned what the <code>map(..)</code> function did -- all long before I had any idea that list operations were a cornerstone of the FPer path and what makes them so important. I knew what <em>map</em> was long before I ever knew it was called <code>map(..)</code>.</p>
<p>Eventually I began to gather all these tidbits of understanding into what I now call &quot;Functional-Light Programming&quot; (FLP).</p>
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>But, why is it so important for you to learn functional programming, even the light form?</p>
<p>I&apos;ve come to believe something very deeply in recent years, so much so you could <em>almost</em> call it a religious belief. I believe that programming is fundamentally about humans, not about code. I believe that code is first and foremost a means of human communication, and only as a <em>side effect</em> (hear my self-referential chuckle) does it instruct the computer.</p>
<p>The way I see it, functional programming is at its heart about using patterns in your code that are well-known, understandable, <em>and</em> proven to keep away the mistakes that make code harder to understand. In that view, FP -- or, ahem, FLP! -- might be one of the most important collections of tools any developer could acquire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The curse of the monad is that... once you understand... you lose the ability to explain it to anyone else.</p>
<p>Douglas Crockford 2012 &quot;Monads and Gonads&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this book &quot;Maybe&quot; breaks the spirit of that curse, even though we won&apos;t talk about &quot;monads&quot; until the very end in the appendices.</p>
<p>The formal FPer will often assert that the <em>real value</em> of FP is in using it essentially 100%: it&apos;s an all-or-nothing proposition. The belief is that if you use FP in one part of your program but not in another, the whole program is polluted by the non-FP stuff and therefore suffers enough that the FP was probably not worth it.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll say unequivocally: <strong>I think that absolutism is bogus</strong>. That&apos;s as silly to me as suggesting that this book is only good if I use perfect grammar and active voice throughout; if I make any mistakes, it degrades the entire book&apos;s quality. Nonsense.</p>
<p>The better I am at writing in a clear, consistent voice, the better this book experience will be for you. But I&apos;m not a 100% perfect author. Some parts will be better written than others. The parts where I can still improve are not going to invalidate the other parts of this book which are useful.</p>
<p>And so it goes with our code. The more you can apply these principles to more parts of your code, the better your code will be. Use them well 25% of the time, and you&apos;ll get some good benefit. Use them 80% of the time, and you&apos;ll see even more benefit.</p>
<p>With perhaps a few exceptions, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find many absolutes in this text. We&apos;ll instead talk about aspirations, goals, principles to strive for. We&apos;ll talk about balance and pragmatism and trade-offs.</p>
<p>Welcome to this journey into the most useful and practical foundations of FP. We both have plenty to learn!</p>
